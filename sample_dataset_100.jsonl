So most Leftist blogs can be summarized in one sentence: \"How DARE anybody question what I believe!\". Rage and abuse substitute for an appeal to facts and reason.\n\nTheir threatened egos sometimes drive Leftists into quite desperate flights from reality. For instance, they often call Israel an \"Apartheid state\" -- when it is in fact the Arab states that practice Apartheid -- witness the severe restrictions on Christians in Saudi Arabia.
